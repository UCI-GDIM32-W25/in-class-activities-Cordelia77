### Activity 1
How to get a good grade(A)? : 

Make sure you understand the meaning of the coding before and after, and know how to use and write by yourself.

### Activity 2

2. 2
3. What do these lines of code do? 

        private void Update() { 
            PrintMessage(); 
        } 
            private void PrintMessage() { 
                Debug.Log(“hello world”); 
        }

Ans: This code shows "hello world" on Console for each frame.
    
   "private" means that only other methods within the *same class* can call this method.
    
   "void" indicates the return type, void means no-return-value.
    
   "Update()" is a special Unity method that is *automatically called once per every frame*.

4. Monobehaviour

    Since MonoBehaviour is the "passport" or "base template class" for all scripts in Unity.

5. Print "x = 10" on the Console when open the game
6. (10): argument; (“x = ” + x): parameter

    use to pass input data to the method/function.

7. To operate on someone (move, rotate) -> Use "transform" (in lowercase, referring to "this object"). 

    To refer to or store the transformation component of an object -> Use Transform (in uppercase, as a variable type).

    *Translate can only be called on an object. Transform is a class.*

8. use *transform* instead of Transform, since Transform is a class.

    Or use _playerTransform instead. Call Translate on the _playerTransform object
